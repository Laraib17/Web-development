    <!-- " id "shortcut:( # ) :stands for identifier unique for every element,when we use java and css fr modification we edit seperate blocks and it would be difficult for us to search each block ,but its easy if we denote a block of code as a identity, eg let a mathematics block be denoted with id="x" as my file has 100's of element but i need to edit specifically that one having mathematics part so, i will use id as a tool to find that mathematical block   -->    
        <div id="unique">this is a paragraph with id named"unique"</div>
        <div id="unique another">this is different paragraph  with named "unique another" </div>
    <br>
    <!-- "Class" shortcut:( . ) :is also used to go to specific part of code, but it is a sub-option and it may have dublicate values, its main benefit is to reduce the repetitive work, class can be common among many parts.-->
        
        <div class="background">this is paragraph with class "background"</div>
        <div class="border">this is a paragraph with class "border"</div>
    
    <!------------------------------------------------------>
    
    <!-- Now we will call class attributes using (.background) -->
        <div class="background"></div>
    <!-- we automatically got this attribute class="background" emmet use div fuction as default function -->
    <!-- if we type (.border.background) -->
        <div class="backgound border"></div>
        <div class="class"></div>
    <!-- since we can use more than one class it will include all the classes in div by consicutives dots-->

    <!------------------------------------------------------->

    <!-- No we well call the id attribute using (#unique) -->
    <div id="any"></div>
    <!-- but if we type existing id eg(#unique) it will not work -->
    #unique
